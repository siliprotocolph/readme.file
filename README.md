A digital portfolio documenting the principles, operations (Ops), and secure communication protocols (`Sili_Protocol`) of the Philippine contingent of the decentralized international activist and hacktivist collective known as **Anonymous**.

---

## üõ°Ô∏è Overview

`Sili_Protocol.PH` is not a centralized organization but a namesake for a set of guidelines and a repository of knowledge used by affiliated actors within the Philippines. Our primary focus is on promoting **digital rights, government transparency, social justice, and humanitarian causes** through coordinated online activism, awareness campaigns, and the promotion of robust operational security (OpSec).

The name "Sili" (Chili) symbolizes our methods: designed to be sharp, potent, and impossible to ignore, leaving a lasting impact on corruption and injustice.

## üéØ Mission & Objectives

Our operations are guided by a core set of objectives:

*   **Digital Activism:** To be a persistent and vocal digital front against corruption, human rights abuses, and misinformation within the Philippine socio-political landscape.
*   **Awareness & Education:** To disseminate crucial information to the public, bypassing traditional media blackouts or biases. To educate fellow Filipinos on digital security, privacy, and their rights online.
*   **Solidarity & Support:** To stand in solidarity with other movements and organizations fighting for democracy, environmental protection, and social welfare.
*   **OpSec Advocacy:** To promote and implement stringent operational security protocols to protect the identities and activities of members and supporters.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Core "Protocols" & Features

The `Sili_Protocol` encompasses our methodologies:

*   **Secure Communication:** Guidelines for using encrypted communication platforms (e.g., **Session, Signal, Keybase**) to coordinate actions.
*   **Information Gathering & Verification:** Techniques for ethically sourcing and fact-checking information before dissemination to avoid spreading misinformation.
*   **Distributed Denial-of-Service (DDoS) Awareness:** Understanding the principles and ethical considerations of digital protests. *(Note: This portfolio does not provide tools or instructions for illegal activities.)*
*   **Propaganda & PsyOps:** Creating impactful graphics, videos, and text-based messages designed for virality and maximum psychological impact to support our campaigns.
*   **OpSec Framework:** A strict set of rules for maintaining anonymity, including compartmentalization, use of VPNs/VPS, Tor, and never revealing personal identifiable information (PII).

## üöÄ Notable Operations & Campaigns

## üîê Operational Security (OpSec)

**This is our highest priority.** Anonymity is our armor.

*   **Identity:** We are a collective idea, not a list of members.
*   **Tools:** Heavy reliance on **Tor**, **TAILS OS**, **Qubes OS**, secure Linux distros, and cryptocurrency for anonymous donations.
*   **Compartmentalization:** Operations are siloed. No single actor has full knowledge of the entire collective.
*   **No Logging:** We do not log user data, IP addresses, or any metadata on our communication channels.

## ü§ù How to Support (Safely)

**Warning: Associating with Anonymous carries inherent risks. Always prioritize your safety.**

1.  **Amplify:** Share our messages and campaigns through your own networks. Use hashtags responsibly.
2.  **Educate Yourself:** Learn about digital security. The best weapon is knowledge.
3.  **Participate in Awareness:** Join peaceful online protests and trending campaigns.
4.  **Donate Anonymously:** If you wish to support infrastructure costs (e.g., secure servers, domains), donations are accepted in **privacy-focused cryptocurrencies** (Monero XMR is preferred).
